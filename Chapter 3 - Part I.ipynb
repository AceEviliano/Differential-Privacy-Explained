Take for the simplest case that we are counting the number of distinct companies in a given district from a database containing only branch name & the parent company name. What will be it's sensitivity ? we are to create parallel databases by knocking of just one row, and if there was a company that was mentioned only in that one row, that is that it has only one branch in that district then the number of companies would go down by 1 else if a company with several branches were knocked out the query would return the same\n",

    "What happens if we keep querying again and again ? the average of the query values will converge to the value of the actual result (try it). Then the analyst on making enough trials knows what our actual result is !!! this is not what we want. So we need to limit the number of times he can query, say we are making the number of queries he can ask as 'm', but this also increases the chance of him being sure of the result so we change our privacy budget from $\\epsilon$ to $\\epsilon/m$ thus, ensuring we retain our privacy budget."
