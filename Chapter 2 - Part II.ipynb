So the discrete set represents all the possible discrete events example B={A,B,C} we can assign the probability os the three events to be a vector (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) there are many other ways we can assign probabilities to each event, the collection of all such assignments is called a probability simplex."

Then $\\mathscr{M}$ returns the element in $B$ with that much probability. To understand the last statement that the probability space is over the coin flips of algorithm $\\mathscr{M}$, remember last time in the notes when we spoke of the random bit strings ? we see any randomized algorithm to be constructed by two parts a deterministic algorithm (algo with know output) and a part that adds a random bit string to this output. So any randomized algo. can be seen as taking in a random bit string and an input belonging to the domain, the random bit strings are nothing but coin flips (1/0, true/false) thus we say the probability space is over the coin flips of $\\mathscr{M}$"
