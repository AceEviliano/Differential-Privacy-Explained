# Regarding Community

The front README might have given the overview of this group's objective. This group does not go about trying to help you read research papers or clarify the doubts or implementation nor does this help you in get to the cutting edge of the research in the fields of AI or Security and Privacy, but I assure this will surely help you achieve these goals by yourself and here is how we think so we will help you as :

1. We will cover the classic text "The Algorithmic Foundations of Privacy" this covers techniques that will help you go through most of the current research in privacy very efficiently without unnecessary external aid.

2. We will cover many aspects of federated learning and hence the baseline research papers that will help you catch up with the privacy aspects of deep learning that are employed today.

3. We will go through basics of deep learning for those who are not familiar through quiz and exercices and thus help the begginers break the ice between them and research in this field. 

Ofcourse there is more to this than that so go ahead and all of you can try it.
